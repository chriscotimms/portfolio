# Portfolio Website
Portfolio website showcasing some work, side projects and my background. 

A single page format using display:grid, I have empahsised the navigation menu header as the landing page. There is an "Access Settings" option, where the user can change the colour scheme, font family and size. 

I have used Intersection Observer to fade the opacity of each section as it comes into view, giving a gentle reveal as the visitor scrolls.
